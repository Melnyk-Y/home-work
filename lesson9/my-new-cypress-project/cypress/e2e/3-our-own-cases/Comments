207     cy.intercept('GET', 'http://localhost:3001/user/settings').as('getSettings')

Intercept is on another port - 3001.
Why?

Where is no interception in the test for the "getSettings" call.
Please consider using this call as cy.wait('getSettings')
https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept

Note: the same in all tests with interceptors.

-> Error while running case

205 cy.visit('http://localhost:3000')

Better using cypress base_url parameter

-> done, but there is localhost:3001

204 it.only('TC2.2 - Update User Information - Ensure that user information (first name, last name, email, phone number) can be updated correctly.', function () {
  Only can be removed when development has been finished. Currently it limits execution only with tests marked with "only".

  -> done

  222 cy.get('button.MuiButton-root').click();

  This last line has no assertions after, so most probably it will not check anything. Please consider adding assertions where needed.
   
   -> // Save updated User Settings

   83 /Drag the first thumb to a new position

   Long comments should not stay after finishing development of the test.

   -> Should I delete it?

120 cy.wait('@getTransactionsPage2').then((interception) => {

    Please consider not using naming with numbers - call1, call2, call3. Better to name calls with the metalingual name.


-> don't understand where are numbers

123 expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.be.oneOf([200, 304]);
Redirect here can be leading to any pages - not always it will be correct behavior.

-> ???
